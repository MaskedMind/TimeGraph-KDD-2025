This repository contains TimeGraphâ€”a synthetic benchmark suite for time-series causal discovery. 
It includes dataset generation scripts, evaluation metrics, and protocols to assess algorithms under realistic conditions. 
Note: the repo is incomplete; full codes, datasets, and a Python library will be released after paper acceptance.
